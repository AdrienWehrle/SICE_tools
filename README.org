* Code descriptions
** extract_esalc.py
+ Clips, reprojects and compresses [[https://www.esa-landcover-cci.org/?q=node/197][ESA global Land Cover (ESALC) products]] (downloadable [[https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-land-cover?tab=form][here]]) for a given region. Converts the resulting .tif file to be usable in the [[https://github.com/mankoff/SICE][SICE toolchain]]. 
+ Iceland, Svalbard, FransJosefLand, NovayaZemlya, SevernayaZemlya, JanMayen, 
NorthernArcticCanada, SouthernArcticCanada, Norway, Beaufort and AntarcticPeninsula 
are currently implemented.
+ Results have been merged in the master branch of the [[https://github.com/mankoff/SICE][SICE toolchain]] and can be found [[https://github.com/mankoff/SICE/tree/master/masks][here]].

**extract_arcticdem.py
+ Clips [https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/arcticdem/][ArcticDEM] (downloadable [[http://data.pgc.umn.edu/elev/dem/setsm/ArcticDEM/mosaic/v3.0/][here]]) derived slopes and slope aspects for a given region based on a mask. 
+ Slopes and slope aspects have been computed using the [[https://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/snap/)][SNAP]] Slope Calculation operator. 
+ Masks have been generated using [[./extract_esalc.py]].
