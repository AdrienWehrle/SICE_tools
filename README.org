* Tools description
** extract_esalc.py
+ Clips, reprojects and compresses [[https://www.esa-landcover-cci.org/?q=node/197][ESA global Land Cover (ESALC) products]] (downloadable [[https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-land-cover?tab=form][here]]) for a given region. Converts the resulting .tif file to be usable in the [[https://github.com/mankoff/SICE][SICE toolchain]]. 
+ Iceland, Svalbard, FransJosefLand, NovayaZemlya, SevernayaZemlya, JanMayen, NorthernArcticCanada, SouthernArcticCanada, Norway, Beaufort and AntarcticPeninsula are currently implemented.
+ Results have been merged in the master branch of the [[https://github.com/mankoff/SICE][SICE toolchain]] and can be found [[https://github.com/mankoff/SICE/tree/master/masks][here]].
+ A description of the 22 [[https://www.esa-landcover-cci.org/?q=node/197][ESA global Land Cover (ESALC) products]] can be found [[https://www.esa-landcover-cci.org/?q=webfm_send/84][here]].

** extract_arcticdem.py
+ Clips [[https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/arcticdem/][ArcticDEM]] (downloadable [[http://data.pgc.umn.edu/elev/dem/setsm/ArcticDEM/mosaic/v3.0/][here]]) derived slopes and slope aspects for a given region based on a mask. 
+ Slopes and slope aspects have been computed using the [[https://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/snap/)][SNAP]] Slope Calculation operator. 
+ Masks have been generated using [[./extract_esalc.py]].

** get_IBOAR.py
+ Computes Effective Solar Zenith Angles (SZA) and Viewing Zenith Angles (VZA) based on [[https://github.com/maximlamare/s3_tools/blob/master/change_tiepoint.py][s3_tools]]. 
+ The Intrinsic Bottom of Atmosphere Reflectance (IBOAR) is calculated for a given scene and given bands. 
+ Uses ArcticDEM derived slopes and slope aspects generated using [[./extract_arcticdem.py]] and Rayleigh corrected Bottom of atmosphere Reflectances (BRR) using the [[https://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/snap/)][SNAP]] Rayleigh Correction Processor.
